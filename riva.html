  <h4> My Core Values: </h4>
  <p> Humility, empathy, and justice are my core values. Whenever I am in conflict I think about what benefits the masses and try to win on behalf of that, which to me feels like justice. When someone else is in conflict I try to see the argument from both sides by calling on empathy. Finally, I believe people should see themselves as nothing more than they are, simple creatures that share 60% of their DNA with bananas.</p>
